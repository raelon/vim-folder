# vim-syncr

A small plugin to sync local and remote files and directories from Vim.

## What?
vim-syncr currently includes just three functions:
* sync current file local -> remote = `:Suplfil` 
* sync current dir local -> remote = `:Supldir` 
* sync current file remote -> local = `:Sdownlf` 

that are mapped by default to:
* (**s**ync **u**p **f**ile) -> `<leader>sf` 
* (**s**ync **u**p **d**irectory) -> `<leader>sd` 
* (**s**ync **d**own **f**ile) -> `<leader>sdf` 

## Why?
Our workflow looks something like this:

```
          worker A   worker B ...
               \       /
        --------------------------
        |          |             |
     remote A   remote B      remote C
```

Each of the remotes is suited to a particular type of analysis, e.g., remote A
is a super computing cluster where 1000s of nodes can be requested for large 
analyses but can have long wait times both for the analysis to start and can
become very laggy when trying to edit remotely. Remotes B and C vary in their
number of processors, RAM, etc., but allow short time-to-run for other analyses.
As a result of these differences it's normal to jump from remote to remote many
times per day, but we want the current code at each remote. While we could set
each remote with its own git repo--commit/push/pull/fetch/etc. is fine, but 
takes additional steps--it can lead to silly mistakes when one thinks they're 
on version B when they forgot to pull and actually ran version A. Allegedly. 
Because I've never done that. Maybe once. In addition, connectivity to B and C 
can be a little wonky, again leading to laggy coding.

Our solution is that each person in the group has a single git repo on their 
local computer and a copy of the reposity is maintained on their accounts on the
remotes. Some folks use Vim, some use Sublime Text, but in both cases we just 
sync the local changes to the remote. SFTP exists for Sublime Text and works 
very well, ending up with something like:

```
               GitHub repo --------- other worker's local repos...
                   |
             local git repo
                   |
        --------------------------
        |          |             |
     remote A   remote B      remote C
```
That is, the remote copies are not git repos, just sync'd versions of the local
git repos. Vim-syncr is not as full-featured as Sublime Text SFTP, but it works 
for the Vimmers in the group.

## How?
As one might guess, vim-syncr uses `rsync` to perform synchronization between a
local repository and a remote copy. The remote machine information is contained
in a configuration file saved at the root of the "project" directory; see
.syncrconf for an example. The current bash functions that drive the sync
operations are hard-coded to exclude certain files (see TODO, below). Note that
this uses the -c flag of rsync to checksum the files rather than just comparing
time stamps.

## Setup
### Basic operation
1. Set up SSH login on the remote machine, if possible; otherwise, you will have
   to enter your password for each sync.
2. Use [Vundle] (https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim) to clone vim-syncr into
   ~/.vim/bundle, or where ever you have your plugins set up. Manual cloning 
   will work just fine as well.
3. Copy the .syncrconf from ~/.vim/bundle/vim-syncr/ to the root directory of 
   your active repository(ies).
4. Edit the .syncrconf as necessary to make the connections work.
5. If you work with the same repo on multiple remote machines, make additional
   copies of .syncrconf but named as, e.g., `syncrconf_server2` and edit the 
   settings as needed. The `serv_switch` script (see below) permits easy 
   switching between remote machines from within vim, and will rename the files
   given the "name" entry in .syncrconf.
6. (optional) Add `autocmd BufWritePost * :Suplfil` to your .vimrc to enable 
   automatic upload to the remote server on each :write. Also works with :Gw if
   using [Fugitive] (https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive).

### Switching the remote target
1. Copy `serv_switch` from ~/.vim/bundle/vim-syncr to the root of your working 
   repository, which will enable simple switching between remote machines.
2. (optional) add `map <Leader>sw :!/path/to/work/repo/serv_switch<cr>` to your 
   .vimrc to make remote server switching easy.

## Usage
### Basic operations
1. Open and edit a file in your working repository, then :w, and last `<leader>sf`.
2. Alternately, alter multiple files in a directory, :w, and `<leader>sd` to
   sync the entire directory (i.e., the parts that have changed).
3. An entire repository can be synced by opening a file at the working 
   repository root (e.g., .syncrconf), then using `<leader>sd` to perform a 
   recursive sync.

### Switching the remote target
1. If you added <Leader>sw to your .vimrc, then and if ',' is your <Leader>, 
   `,sw` will spawn a dialog providing the "name" field of all .syncrconf* 
   files in the repo root.
2. Choose the number of the remote machine you want to which you want to sync
   and the change will be made.

## Other options?
`sftp` can also do the job, particularly for single files, and you might check out
[vim-sftp] (https://github.com/hesselbom/vim-hsftp) - from which the config
parsing in vim-syncr was derived! - to see if it better fits your needs. However,
when working in a large repository where only a small number of files (and/or a
small portion of a few files) might change, syncing tends to be faster. There's
also a little more control (and highlighting!) using vim-syncr...but more could
be done to make it even more flexible.

## TODO (in general order of importance)
* Add rsync --exclude items to config file for more flexibility than the
  hard-coded excludes currently in-place.
* Other things, I'm sure...
